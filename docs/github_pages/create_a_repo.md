If your site is an independent project, you can create a new repository to store
your site's source code. If your site is associated with an existing project,
you can add the source code to that project's repository, in a /docs folder on
the default branch or on a different branch. For example, if you're creating a
site to publish documentation for a project that's already on GitHub, you may
want to store the source code for the site in the same repository as the
project.

If the account that owns the repository uses GitHub Free or GitHub Free for
organizations, the repository must be public.

If you want to create a site in an existing repository, skip to the "Creating
your site" section.
